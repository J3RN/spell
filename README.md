The spelling bot

## What is spell?

Spell is a bot to correct spelling. When in a channel with spell, simply say:
```
spell: Spell this sentance!
```
And spell will obediently reply:
```
<your nick here> meant to say "spell this sentence!"
```

## Commands

### All user commands
- `!!top<x>`: Spell will list the top `x` number of words said. Only works for single digits (on purpose).

### Master commands
- `!!annoying`: Enable annoying mode. Spell will correct everything said in all channels. Everything.
- `!!stop`: Disable annoying mode. Spell will stop correcting everything said everywhere.
- `!!join <channel>`: Spell will join that channel.
- `!!part`: Spell will leave the current channel.
- `!!add`: Adds a word to the dictionary
